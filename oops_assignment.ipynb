    "#5 What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "In Python, there are three types of access modifiers used to define the accessibility of class attributes and methods. These are public, protected, and private. Here is an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public: Public members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. They are the default access level in Python. Public members are denoted by not adding any special prefix to the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: name\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Protected members are accessible within the class and by subclasses (child classes). They are denoted by a single underscore (_) prefix before the name.\n",

    "\n",
    "Private: Private members are accessible only within the class where they are defined. They are denoted by a double underscore () prefix before the name. Python performs name mangling to restrict access.\n",

    "Example: __name\n",

    "#6 Describe the five types of inheritance in Python. Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "In Python, inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class. There are five types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance  \n",
    "   In this type, a child class inherits from a single parent class.  \n",
    "   Example: A class Dog inherits from a class Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance  \n",
    "   In this type, a child class inherits from more than one parent class.  \n",
    "   Example: A class Student inherits from both Person and Learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance  \n",
    "   In this type, a class inherits from another class, which itself is inherited from another class.  \n",
    "   Example: A class Grandchild inherits from Child, which inherits from Parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance  \n",
    "   In this type, multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.  \n",
    "   Example: Classes Cat and Dog inherit from the class Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance  \n",
    "   This is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, such as a mix of multiple and hierarchical inheritance.  \n",
    "   Example: A complex structure combining features of different inheritance types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"I am a person\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Worker:\n",
    "    def work(self):\n",
    "        return \"I am working\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Student(Person, Worker):\n",
    "    def study(self):\n",
    "        return \"I am studying\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "s = Student()\n",
    "print(s.speak())  # Output: I am a person\n",
    "print(s.work())   # Output: I am working\n",
    "print(s.study())  # Output: I am studying\n",

    "#7 What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : \n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python searches for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy. It is used in the context of inheritance to determine the sequence of classes that are checked when a method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRO follows the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent and predictable order. It searches the current class first, then moves to its parent classes, and so on. If multiple inheritance is involved, it ensures that the method is only called once per class in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can retrieve the MRO programmatically using the mro method or the _mro_ attribute.\n",

    "#13 Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance. How does Python resolve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans : \n",
    "The Diamond Problem arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common parent class. This creates a diamond-shaped inheritance structure. The issue occurs when the child class ends up inheriting methods or properties from the parent class through both its parents, leading to ambiguity about which method or property should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the problem, imagine the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       A\n",
    "      / \\\n",
    "     B   C\n",
    "      \\ /\n",
    "       D\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, class D inherits from both B and C, while both B and C inherit from A. If both B and C override methods from A, and D inherits from both, there could be confusion about which version of the method D should inherit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python handles this problem using the C3 Linearization algorithm, which is designed to provide a consistent method resolution order (MRO). The MRO ensures that each class in the inheritance chain is considered only once, and it specifies the order in which classes are searched for methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates how Python handles the Diamond Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def hello(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def hello(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def hello(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.hello()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, classes B and C both override the hello method of class A. Class D inherits from both B and C. When the hello() method is called on an object of class D, Python uses the MRO to determine which method to execute. According to Python’s MRO, class B is checked first, then class C, and finally class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this code will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello from B\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python resolves this by using the C3 Linearization, which ensures that each class is called in a clear, predictable order. You can see the MRO of class D by calling D.mro(), which returns the order in which methods will be resolved:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "print(D.mro())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the MRO, showing the classes Python checks in order when looking for methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Python solves the Diamond Problem by using the C3 Linearization method, ensuring that the classes are checked in a consistent and clear order, avoiding ambiguity."

    "1. The class YearChecker contains a static method is_leap_year, which takes a year as an argument and checks if it is a leap year.\n",

    "   - It is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, or\n",
    "   - It is divisible by 400.\n",
    "3. The static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator, meaning it does not require an instance of the class to be called.\n",
    "4. The method returns True if the year is a leap year, and False otherwise.\n",
    "5. In the example usage, the method is called with the year 2024, and it prints whether the year is a leap year or not.\n",
